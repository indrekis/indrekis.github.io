Rampage AT                                          AST Part Number 202079-001

The Rampage AT is a memory expansion adapter for the IBM PC/AT and 100%
compatibles running at *6MHz.  Memory can be expanded on this board from 512K
to 2048K using industry standard 256K dynamic RAM chips with a minimum speed
requirement of 120NS.  Memory standards supported by the Rampage AT include
conventional (base 640K), linear extended, LIM 3.2, LIM 4.0, and EEMS.

    * Later versions of the Rampage AT are rated for 8MHz operation.
      The part number on the solder (non-component) side of the board
      determines which revision you have.  If the part number is
      202079-302C or 202079-302D, the Rampage is rated for 8MHz
      operation. Any other revision is rated for 6MHz only.

        NOTE: The above settings define how much of the memory on the Rampage
              will be used as conventional (base 640K) and/or extended linear
              memory.  Any memory not used by these settings will be available
              as EMS expanded memory.

              If the Rampage is to be used exclusively as EMS expanded memory,
              set the switches on Bank 2 (below) accordingly, and the above
              settings will be ignored.

    DUAL PAGE MODE

        SW1-9     ON=ENABLED     OFF=DISABLED

            NOTE: Dual page mode allows expanded memory to maintain two sets
                  of mapping registers, which ensures proper multitasking
                  operation.  Generally, dual page mode is enabled. (SW1-9 ON)

        SW2-8 - Memory Parity Checking

        The above list of addresses is not complete.  After the 3072K
        address, we have listed the settings for every megabyte only.
        Switches 5,6 & 7 determine the addresses between.  If you are
        unable to extrapolate the correct starting address from the above
        information, contact AST to order the complete documentation.

        NOTE: Linear memory installed previous to the Rampge would consist of
              Base memory (maximum 640K) plus extended memory (non-EMS)
              installed in the system before the Rampage is installed.  If the
              starting address is set below 640K, the Rampage will
              automatically "backfill" base memory up to 640K, with the
              remainder of linear memory going to extended memory.

              You will have to adjust your machines CMOS with your set-up
              program only if you add conventional or extended linear memory
              with the Rampage AT.  Do not change the set-up to reflect
              expanded EMS memory.
